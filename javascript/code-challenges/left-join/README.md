# Hash Map Left Join

Write a function called left join  
The first parameter is a hash map that has word strings as keys, and a synonym of the key as values.  
The second parameter is a hashmap that has word strings as keys, and antonyms of the key as values.  
Return: The returned data structure that holds the results is up to you. It doesnâ€™t need to exactly match the   output below, so long as it achieves the LEFT JOIN logic  

Notes:  
Combine key and values into new ds according to LEFT JOIN  
LEFT JOIN:  
Return all the values in first map, results row Contains values that are in right map.  
Null or something to that effect if no values.

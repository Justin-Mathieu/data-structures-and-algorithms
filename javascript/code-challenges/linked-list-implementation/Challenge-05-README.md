# Code Challenge 05(Linked List Implementation)

 Create a linked list class and write the methods to insert a node, verify if a value is included in the list and return a string of the list.

## Whiteboard Process

## Approach & Efficiency

The code provided was a great starting point.To insert the node I assigned the head to the new node. To check for inclusion I iterated over the list and checked for the value. To print the list I iterated over the list and used display function.

## Solution

The methods can be impelmented by calling them on the list.  
`const list = new LinkedList<string>();
list.tostring();`

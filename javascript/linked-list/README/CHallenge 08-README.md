## Approach & Efficiency

Added a counter variable to check for evens and odds and appended the nodes from list 1 on the even counts and the nodes from list 2 on the odd count. then I checked for if the lists were longer and appended the rest of the remaining list.

## Solution

Method on the linked list class.

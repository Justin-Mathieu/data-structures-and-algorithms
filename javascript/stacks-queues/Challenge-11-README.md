## Whiteboard Process

## Approach & Efficiency 

I relied heavily on solution code from repo.

**Push:**
 if the length of the array is equal to the max height we create a new stack if is is not at maxheight thew nwe push to that stack. 
**Pop:**
we check to see if the last value in the array is a stack and pop the top of or pop the stack off if there is only the one value.

## Solution

Methods on the set of stacks class
